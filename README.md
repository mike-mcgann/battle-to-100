# battle-to-100

McG and the KID have an active 100 point backgammon match. I have the habit
of losing the scoresheet so it is now forever enshrined using a version
control system.

### House Rules

- If doubles are rolled when starting the game, the cube is automatically
doubled but remains in the neutral position. This is notated on the
scoresheet with a single asterisk (*).
- If doubles are rolled twice in a row when starting the game, the cube
is automatically redoubled but remains in the neutral position. This is
notated on the scoresheet with a double asterisk (**).
- A modified Jacoby rule is in effect. Gammons and backgammons only count
if the cube value is greater than one.
- The scoresheet notates gammons with a (G) and backgammons with a (B).
- Cube values of 16 are notated with an (X), 32 with a (Y), and 64 with a (Z). 
- Winning a game with a final roll of doubles when doubles are required
to win awards "style points". These points mean nothing but are notated on the
scoresheet with an exclamation point (!) for use later when bragging about the
miracle.
- After a player has completed a move and before the opponent has picked up
the dice, the opponent may declare the previous move as a blunder. The player must
either acknowledge the blunder or appeal the decision to [XG](https://www.extremegammon.com/).
All decisions by [XG](https://www.extremegammon.com/) are final. 
- Liability is capped at 50 points.
- The winner of the match is the first person to exceed 100 points. Points earned in excess
of 100 on the final game are valid in calculating the match point differential. If additional
games are played after a match win is awarded, those games are automatically
applied to the next match. 
- Upon completion of the match, the winner shall be presented with a [trophy](https://www.yourprops.com/Puggy-Weaver-Bowling-Record-Trophy-original-set-dressing-pieces-Married-With-Children-TV-1987-YP821656.html).
